                    Egypt
                    and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)[1] with the political

                    ancient
                    Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as
                    Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle
